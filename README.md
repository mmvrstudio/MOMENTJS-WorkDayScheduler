## Description:

The goal of this project was to create a simple workday scheduler. The scheduler has a row to represent each hour of the typical workday (i.e., 9AM to 5PM) where the user can enter and save tasks for that given hour. Each hour is color-coded based on whether it has passed, is current, or is in the future.
